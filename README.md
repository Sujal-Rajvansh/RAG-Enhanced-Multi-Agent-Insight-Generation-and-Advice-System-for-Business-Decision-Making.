# **RAG-Enhanced Multi-Agent Insight Generation and Advice System for Business Decision-Making**

---

## **Overview**
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system powered by a multi-agent architecture. It combines advanced AI techniques such as **LangChain**, **FAISS**, **HuggingFace Embeddings**, **Ollama's Llama 3.2**, and **LangGraph** to assist businesses in extracting insights, receiving financial advice, and ensuring legal compliance. This system is designed to support interactive, contextual, and sequential decision-making workflows.

## **Key Features**

### 1. **Multi-Agent System**
- **General Agent**: Extracts and summarizes key insights from the document.
- **Financial Agent**: Provides actionable financial planning and investment advice.
- **Legal Agent**: Advises on legal compliance and business requirements.

### 2. **Interactive Workflow**
- Uses a **Graph-Based Execution Framework** to manage agent dependencies.
- Agents execute sequentially, passing context and outputs downstream.
- Enhances interactivity by adapting responses based on prior outputs.

### 3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**
- **FAISS** stores and retrieves relevant document chunks for precise contextual analysis.
- Agents utilize the retrieved context for personalized and insightful responses.

### 4. **Document Embedding and Vectorization**
- **HuggingFace Sentence Transformers** create embeddings for semantic search.
- Enables quick and accurate retrieval of relevant information from large datasets.

### 5. **Comprehensive Use Cases**
- Strategic business planning.
- Financial decision-making and compliance.
- Legal advisory and risk management.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Installation**

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or above.

### Install Required Libraries
```bash
pip install langchain langchain-community langchain-ollama langgraph faiss-cpu fpdf pypdf huggingface_hub colab-xterm
üöÄ Workflow
Step 1: Document Preparation
Create or upload a PDF containing business-related insights such as market trends, financial planning, and legal guidelines.
Save the document (e.g., sample_document.pdf) in the project directory.
Step 2: PDF Processing
Load and process the document using PyPDFLoader and split it into chunks using CharacterTextSplitter.
Create embeddings using HuggingFace Sentence Transformers for efficient vector search.
Step 3: Multi-Agent System
Define the roles of the three agents:
General Agent: Provides a summary of key insights.
Financial Agent: Offers detailed financial planning advice.
Legal Agent: Advises on legal compliance and requirements.
Build a graph-based workflow using LangGraph to manage the agent pipeline.
Step 4: Sequential Execution
Input a query (e.g., "What are the key insights in this document?").
Agents execute sequentially:
General Agent summarizes insights.
Financial Agent provides financial advice based on the summary.
Legal Agent offers legal recommendations based on financial advice.
Step 5: Interactive Outputs
Outputs from each agent are displayed interactively, allowing users to explore insights, financial planning, and legal compliance comprehensively.
